# Description
A program that utilizes OOP and serialization to create a mock course registration system for a school.

## Assumptions/Guidelines
<br>

There are a few assumptions that I am working under:

1. The school will provide the following information about each course: `course name`, `course ID`, `max # of students that can be registered`, `current # of registered students`, `list of names of registered students`, `instructor`, `section number`, and `location`.

2. There are only two types of users: `Admin` and `Student`.

3. `Admin` users can: 

    a. Create a new course <br>
    b. Delete a course <br>
    c. Edit a course <br>
    d. Display information for a given course by `course ID` <br>
